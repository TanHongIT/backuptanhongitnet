Website https://tanhongit.net currently stopped posting since February 2020, but I still maintain its existence on the internet.

Because of a beautiful memory with the website, I have moved the overall source code from PHP to static HTML for backup as a souvenir. However, there are still many errors in this static HTML source.

Currently, tanhongit has established a new site at https://tanhongit.com, specializing in sharing programming knowledge and synthesizing some computer tips and technology. Hope you welcome to read. <3
